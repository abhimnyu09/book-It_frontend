# ðŸš€ BookIt: Experiences (Frontend)

This is the frontend for the **BookIt** application, a fullstack project built for a technical assignment. It's a React-based web app that allows users to browse and book travel experiences.

This application is built with React (using Vite), TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. It fetches all its data from the [BookIt Backend API](https://github.com/abhimnyu09/book-It_backend) .

## âœ¨ Features

* **Browse Experiences:** Fetches and displays a grid of all available experiences.
* **Dynamic Search:** A global search bar in the header filters experiences by title in real-time.
* **Detailed View:** Click any experience to see a detailed page with a full description, image, and "About" section.
* **Real-time Availability:** The Details Page fetches real-time booking data. If a slot is already booked, it's visibly disabled and marked as "Booked".
* **Interactive Booking:** Users can select a date, time, and quantity. The price summary updates dynamically.
* **Promo Codes:** A user can apply a promo code (`SAVE10`, `FLAT100`) which is validated by the backend and applied to the final price.
* **Form Validation:** The checkout form validates that all user information (name, email, terms agreement) is filled out before allowing a booking.
* **End-to-End Flow:** Complete user flow from Home -> Details -> Checkout -> Confirmation.
